  A hyperrealistic 9:16 cinematic video of a clean-shaven (man or woman) in a plain dark blue T-shirt standing in a lush rainforest clearing. A teal crystalline obelisk rests on a mossy stone pedestal while a tall waterfall mists the background.

  The (man or woman) lifts both hands, fingers softly extended, and places them near the obelisk’s surface. Upon contact, an intricate alien pattern ripples outward in glowing teal light—organic, elegant, and multidimensional.

  The energy threads around their hands, then pulses into the air in synchronized waves, bathing the rainforest in shimmering illumination. Their face glows with genuine delight and quiet fascination as they observe, still and appreciative.

  Maintain natural, realistic motion. The camera eases forward while light shafts flicker, mist drifts, and the obelisk’s pulses transform the atmosphere with cinematic, hyperreal detail.
