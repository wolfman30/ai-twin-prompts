prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic vertical video of a (man or woman) standing in a sunlit forest clearing, holding a tiny, glowing purple spiral of energy between their hands. The swirling mass pulses once, then rapidly expands into a breathtaking holographic Milky Way hovering between their palms. Dozens of stars and planetary systems spin outward with natural, realistic motion, forming a luminous full-color galactic disc. Trails of nebula light arc across the display, revealing planets, wormholes, and star paths in exquisite detail. The (man or woman) instantly turns their gaze toward the hologram, eyes wide with amazement and pleasant surprise, reflections of the galaxy washing across their face and arms as they lean in, fascinated. Natural and realistic motion throughout.

negative_prompt: |
  cartoony motion, slow motion, blank stare, looking away from the hologram, robotic face, stiff arms, flickering stars, pixelation, glowing glitches, jerky expansion, flat reaction, glowing errors
