prompt: |

  In a sunlit forest clearing, a (man or woman) holds a tiny, glowing purple spiral of energy between his hands. The swirling mass pulses onceâ€”then rapidly expands into a stunning holographic representation of the Milky Way, hovering between his palms. Dozens of stars and planetary systems spin outward with natural and realistic motion, forming a floating, full-color galactic disc. Trails of nebula light arc across the display, with fine detail revealing planets, wormholes, and star paths. The (man or woman) immediately turns his gaze toward the hologram, eyes wide with visible amazement and pleasant surprise. His expression is alive with wonder as he watches the galactic structure unfold. Reflections of the galaxy swirl across his face and arms as he slowly leans in, fascinated. Natural and realistic motion throughout.

  cartoony motion, slow motion, blank stare, looking away from the hologram, robotic face, stiff arms, flickering stars, pixelation, glowing glitches, jerky expansion, flat reaction, glowing errors
