prompt: |
  In an alien-engineered rainforest glowing with soft teal light, a (man or woman) stands surrounded by dense foliage. He begins facing forward, then slowly turns his head and upper body to the right in a smooth, natural motion as a towering spiral of luminous turquoise energy coils upward around a tall organic pillar. His eyes widen slightly in awe as the spiral pulses gently, emitting shimmering waves of light. As he turns, soft blue reflections illuminate his face, timed with the energy pulses. The light spiral rotates slowly with natural and realistic motion, and small glowing fragments drift upward into the treetop canopy. The man breathes steadily, visibly moved but calm, fully immersed in the surreal beauty. Nearby leaves sway subtly, responding to unseen electromagnetic vibrations from the alien structure. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
