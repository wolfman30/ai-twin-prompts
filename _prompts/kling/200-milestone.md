prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic vertical video of a (man or woman) standing in a glowing forest clearing before a large floating neon “200” composed of radiant magenta light. As they reach out and touch the numbers, the display responds immediately—splitting apart with natural, realistic motion into hundreds of tiny glowing fragments that swirl around like intelligent fireflies. The fragments choreograph a holographic celebration of spiraling alien symbols, shimmering data streams, and bursts of luminous fractal geometry, all synchronized in joyful rhythm. Glowing circuits blaze briefly across the ground, forming a grand alien emblem beneath their feet. The (man or woman)'s eyes widen and they laugh with genuine delight, surprised and honored by the display—an alien-designed congratulations sequence marking their transformation. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
