prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic cinematic video featuring a (man or woman) standing in a misty, cool-toned tropical rainforest at dawn. He wears a fitted dark blue t-shirt and has short, slightly messy dark hair with light stubble. He stands confidently in front of a glowing, futuristic spacecraft doorway that has just opened behind himâ€”its soft cyan light spilling into the jungle, partially illuminating the foliage and his back. The man naturally smiles with excitement and calm wonder, then slowly turns around and begins walking toward the spacecraft entrance. Subtle cinematic camera movement follows behind or from the side, capturing the moment as he steps forward with purpose. The rainforest remains moody, with soft magenta and indigo ambient tones, and the atmosphere suggests ascension, evolution, and a threshold into the unknown. Vertical 9:16 format, vivid lighting and smooth cinematic motion.
