    Create a 10-second hyperrealistic vertical 4K video (9:16) using the provided image. The setting is a misty tropical rainforest just before sunrise, glowing with indigo, teal, and magenta tones. Fog drifts gently between tall palms, and the jungle path is damp and reflective. The mood is quiet and cinematic.

    The (man or woman) stands barefoot in the center of the frame, holding a glowing orb in both hands. The orb emits a soft violet-magenta light, casting subtle illumination on their face, chest, and arms. They are grounded, peaceful, and curious—not performing, just present.

    First 1–2 Seconds (Hook):
    Begin with a sudden flicker of energy inside the orb, accompanied by a low hum. The light sharpens briefly, casting stronger reflections on their hands and shirt. Their eyebrows lift slightly, adjusting their grip—subtle, natural intrigue. This moment is the visual hook.

    3–7 Seconds (Mid Sequence):
    They slowly rotate the orb. As it moves, particles of light swirl within—like glowing dust or shifting constellations. Mist reacts subtly. Light pulses from the orb sync gently with ambient sounds. Their eyes stay fixed on the orb, calm and focused.

    8–10 Seconds (Closing Moment):
    The orb emits a soft beam of violet light upward, vanishing into the canopy. At the same time, their expression shifts—not shocked, but deeply aware, as if understanding something unseen. A faint symbol flickers briefly on the orb or in their palm, then fades. The mist thickens slightly as the glow softens.

    Use soft handheld-style motion, shallow depth of field, realistic skin glow and fabric detail. Keep lighting cool and atmospheric. The overall feel should be scroll-stopping, immersive, and cinematic—a quiet moment of wonder and discovery.
