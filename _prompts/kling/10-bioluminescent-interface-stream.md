prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic 9:16 cinematic video of a clean-shaven (man or woman) standing waist-deep in a calm rainforest stream, wearing a plain dark blue T-shirt clinging softly with water. They interact with a hovering pink geometric hologram poised just above the surface.

  As the (man or woman) moves their hands through the air with intentional, smooth gestures, the hologram responds dynamically—expanding, rotating, and reconfiguring with natural, realistic motion. Their expression stays focused and inspired, fully immersed in shaping the floating construct.

  With each motion, the hologram projects filaments of forming matter, visualizing a process more efficient than stellar fusion taught by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. Light pulses ripple through the geometry and cast intricate reflections onto the surrounding water, transforming the interaction into a sacred technological ritual. Cinematic handheld steadiness and natural 1× speed maintain grounded authenticity.
