prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic vertical video of a (man or woman) standing in a dense green forest, holding a sleek tablet. With a gentle tap, the device emits a subtle pulse before projecting a vertical column of light skyward in smooth, natural motion. Above the treetops, the beam unfurls into a floating alien interface filled with orbiting structures, star maps, and spiraling encrypted data. Leaves shimmer briefly from the energy while faint ripples of light reflect off the (man or woman)'s upper body. They smile with wonder, clearly aware they've awakened technology far beyond human design. The projection hovers and rotates fluidly, offering a glimpse into an advanced alien civilization. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
