prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic 9:16 vertical cinematic video of (a man or woman) standing in a misty tropical forest, wearing a fitted dark t-shirt. He stands in side profile, holding his hand out in front of him with his palm open. Floating just above his hand is a glowing neon teal “3K” hologram, softly flickering like advanced alien technology.

  The video begins with him gazing at the “3K” in appreciation. Then, in one smooth, deliberate motion, he lifts his hand upward, and the “3K” follows — pushed into the air like it’s weightless and digital, rising with a subtle particle trail, magnetic shimmer, or rotating glyph ring as it ascends. It lingers mid-air as a symbol of breakthrough.

  His expression is calm but proud — a quiet celebration of growth. The camera slowly zooms or pans to emphasize the moment. The rainforest glows faintly in teal and indigo, with soft fog and cinematic shadows. The visual style must feel real and grounded, like it was filmed on an iPhone Pro Max 16 — no CGI look, no cartoon styling, just believable sci-fi realism with emotional weight.

  This moment should feel like a futuristic ritual — marking a milestone not with noise, but with intention.
