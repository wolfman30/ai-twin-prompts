prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic 9:16 vertical cinematic video of a clean-shaven (man or woman) standing in a misty tropical forest, wearing a fitted dark T-shirt. Shot from a natural side profile, they hold one hand out with the palm open while a neon teal “3K” hologram floats just above it, softly flickering like advanced alien technology.

  The moment begins with them admiring the hologram. In one smooth, intentional motion they raise their hand, and the “3K” ascends with them—weightless and digital—leaving behind a subtle particle trail, magnetic shimmer, or rotating glyph ring as it rises to linger mid-air.

  Their expression is calm yet proud, a quiet celebration of growth. The camera eases in with a gentle zoom or pan to emphasise the ritual, while teal and indigo light glows through soft fog and cinematic shadows. The scene feels grounded and real, like footage from an iPhone Pro Max 16, delivering believable sci-fi realism with emotional weight. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
