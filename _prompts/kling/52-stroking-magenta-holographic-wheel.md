prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic 9:16 cinematic video of a clean-shaven (man or woman) kneeling in a narrow rainforest path, wearing a plain dark blue T-shirt. Mist hangs in the air; towering trees and dripping ferns enclose the scene.

  Before them floats a glowing magenta alien energy wheel. During training with an advanced race, they reach out and rotate the inner ring with slow, deliberate precision.

  The environment responds instantly: clouds swirl overhead, shafts of light flicker through the canopy, and wind sweeps across leaves. Atmospheric lighting shifts—mist thickens or clears in sync with each motion, as if tuning the forest’s mood in real time.

  The (man or woman) watches in awe yet stays focused, realizing they’re learning to shape weather itself. A subtle camera push-in tracks the interaction as the wheel pulses brighter and turns with every input. Maintain natural, realistic motion and a cinematic finish fit for a high-end sci-fi feature.
