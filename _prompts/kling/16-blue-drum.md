prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic 9:16 cinematic video of a clean-shaven (man or woman) in a dimly lit alien jungle grotto, wearing a plain dark blue T-shirt. They stand before a hovering blue circular plate levitating just above an organic podium of roots and stone.

  With rhythmic, relaxed motion, the (man or woman) taps the plate like a drum. Each touch triggers cascading waves of light and shimmering sound that ripple outward in natural, realistic motion. Intricate holographic patterns bloom from the plate—floating symbols, audio-reactive visuals, and rotating alien interfaces that hover midair.

  The (man or woman) smiles and laughs, clearly enjoying the immersive educational experience. An unseen overhead projector synchronizes glowing patterns across their shirt, pulsing in time with each strike. Colored illumination washes softly over their face and chest, capturing genuine delight. Cinematic handheld steadiness and natural 1× speed preserve the grounded authenticity of the moment.
