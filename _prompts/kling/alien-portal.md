    The (man or woman) stands in front of a shimmering magenta wormhole embedded in a glowing jungle wall at twilight. The scene feels natural, like real-life footage captured on an iPhone Pro Max 16, with cinematic ambient fog, soft atmospheric lighting, and grounded color tones. The portal pulses gently with concentric alien energy rings, radiating light and subtle motion, like sentient technology in standby mode. The man pauses briefly, glancing at the swirling energy. His breath is visible as he hesitates for a second, expression flickering with awe and uncertainty. Then, sensing urgency, he quickly walks forward with a smooth, natural stride—fluid and purposeful, as if he knows it might vanish. As his hand breaks the portal’s surface, it ripples with soft liquid light. Once he's through, the wormhole visibly reacts: the energy rings contract inward and collapse smoothly into a glowing seam that seals itself with a final pulse, as if locking the exit. The camera tracks naturally behind him—handheld style—as he steps onto an alien coastline at dusk, greeted by luminous terrain, twin crescent moons, and distant rock spires. He gazes around, visibly amazed. His body language subtly shifts—more upright, confident—as if the alien tech is beginning to influence him. Natural and realistic motion throughout, photoreal quality, captured like real-world video.
