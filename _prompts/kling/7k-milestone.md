prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic 9:16 cinematic video of a clean-shaven (man or woman) standing in a misty forest clearing, wearing a plain dark blue T-shirt. Their hand rests calmly beneath a glowing magenta hologram shaped as a perfect number 7—crisp, unmistakable, with a vertical line and sharp top stroke angled from left to right. They gaze at it with subtle joy, brown eyes reflecting curiosity and awe while their expression stays natural and relaxed.

  After one second of stillness, the hologram pulses softly; the 7’s vertical line remains anchored while the angled top stroke folds downward and separates, morphing smoothly into a flawless capital letter K. The transformation flows with hyperreal detail, shimmering energy, and intelligently choreographed light, symbolising the milestone of 7K views.

  The new “K” floats steady above their hand, emitting gentle magenta light as energy particles swirl. The (man or woman) continues to watch with quiet wonder, posture relaxed, body still, savoring the intention of the alien ritual. Cinematic handheld motion, natural 1× speed, and grounded lighting keep the moment feeling filmed on an iPhone Pro Max 16. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
