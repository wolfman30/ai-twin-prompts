prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic vertical video of a (man or woman) walking slowly and purposefully through a surreal forest of towering alien mushrooms that emit vibrant pink and blue bioluminescent light. Dense purple mist swirls around their legs, trailing their movement with natural, realistic motion. As they move forward, the massive mushrooms overhead pulse gently in response, creating a rhythm of light that bathes the mist in a mesmerizing glow. Their arms sway subtly at their sides, posture steady and calm, fully captivated by the mysterious landscape. Light shifts dynamically with each step, deepening the dreamlike atmosphere. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
