prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic 9:16 cinematic video of a clean-shaven (man or woman) in a misty tropical forest, framed by tall palms and indigo-tinted fog. They wear a fitted black T-shirt and stand centered with calm intensity, eyes focused forward.

  A translucent cyan-blue holographic interface floats before them—minimalist yet advanced—with screens, data streams, and icons shifting and rotating mid-air. The (man or woman) interacts with precision: tapping, swiping, and zooming elements as if orchestrating a powerful design system.

  The camera glides with a subtle orbit or slow push-in to capture the fluidity of both gestures and interface. Soft cinematic lighting, gentle lens flares, and reflections from the hologram illuminate their face, revealing unwavering concentration.

  The rainforest backdrop glows in cool indigo and blue-green hues, suggesting mystery and harmony between nature and technology. The scene embodies a breakthrough moment where self, design, and AI merge seamlessly.

  Maintain hyperrealistic quality reminiscent of an iPhone Pro Max 16 capture—grounded lighting, natural motion, and zero CGI gloss.
