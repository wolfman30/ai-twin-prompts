prompt: |
    The (man or woman) stands in a lush, green environment, arms raised with open hands as three glowing magenta energy spheres hover above him. The orbs begin to pulse with intense light and oscillate in place, emitting soft electrical ripples that shimmer through the air. Suddenly, the lowest orb spirals downward, spinning rapidly while releasing tendrils of light that wrap around his fingertips with natural and realistic motion. As the light connects with his hands, his eyes widen and his mouth opens in a joyful, astonished expression. The second orb splits into smaller fragments, which orbit around his upper body in synchronized loops, glowing and leaving trails of magenta particles behind. The man subtly shifts his stance and leans back slightly, overwhelmed by the visual spectacle unfolding in front of him. The third orb rapidly expands, forming a holographic alien glyph mid-air that rotates slowly while casting light patterns on the surrounding foliage and his skin. The man begins to softly move his hands as if controlling the glyph's motion, sparks reacting fluidly to each gesture. Natural and realistic motion.
