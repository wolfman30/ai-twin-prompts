prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic vertical video of a (man or woman) standing calmly in a lush, mist-covered jungle while a large alien craft hovers silently overhead. A focused beam of soft blue light shines down from the craft, enveloping them from above. The light flickers gently with natural, realistic motion, scanning their body and synchronizing with their energy. Subtle air currents rustle nearby leaves as the beam activates. The (man or woman)'s arms remain relaxed at their sides while they look upward, expression transitioning from curiosity to quiet understanding. Light particles shimmer around them, hinting at imminent transport or advanced communication. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
