prompt: |
  A (man or woman) stands waist-deep in a calm forest stream, interacting with a glowing, pink geometric hologram hovering in front of him. As he gently moves his hands through the air, the structure dynamically responds—expanding, rotating, and reconfiguring with natural and realistic motion. The (man or woman)’s expression is focused and inspired, fully engaged in shaping the floating construct. As he gestures, the hologram begins projecting filaments of forming matter—visualizing a process more efficient than stellar fusion, taught by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. Light pulses through the structure, casting intricate reflections onto the rippling water around him. The entire interaction feels like a sacred technological ritual, an initiation into world-creation knowledge. Natural and realistic motion throughout.

negative_prompt: |
  cartoony motion, slow motion, stiff hand gestures, blank face, looking away from the hologram, flickering geometry, robotic animation, pixelation, glowing glitches, jerky movement, broken reflections
