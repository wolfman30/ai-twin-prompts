  A hyperrealistic 9:16 cinematic video of a clean-shaven (man or woman) standing in a lush rainforest clearing, holding a sleek smartphone infused with alien energy. They wear a plain dark blue T-shirt, subtly darkened by mist.

  With natural, fluid motion, the (man or woman) taps the screen with their thumb. The phone responds instantly: light pours from its edges as a large holographic projection erupts upward, spinning into a dazzling 3D interface filled with luminous alien glyphs and floating data streams. The (man or woman) leans back slightly in amazement, eyes tracking the swirling shapes while body language remains relaxed and believable.

  A transparent alien figure briefly materializes within the projection, delivering a personalized visual message before dissolving into cascading symbols. The hologram expands outward, lifting particles of light around the subject like an intelligent atmosphere. Their smile broadens—genuine, amazed—as the interface shifts into a magenta-and-violet star map rotating above the phone, resembling a window to another dimension. Cinematic handheld steadiness, natural 1× speed, and realistic lighting keep the moment grounded.
