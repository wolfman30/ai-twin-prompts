prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic vertical video of a (man or woman) standing beside a massive magenta alien tree with textured bark, gazing upward in wonder. Glowing crystalline lifeforms hover from the branches, drifting slowly upward and leaving soft trails of sparkling light with natural, realistic motion. Each crystal rotates gently and pulses as it ascends, casting luminous reflections across the (man or woman)'s smiling face. Subtle movements in their head and eyes follow the floating forms, brimming with curiosity and awe. Ambient lighting shifts as every glowing shape rises, painting dynamic patterns across the tree and the (man or woman)'s upper body. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
