prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic vertical video of a (man or woman) standing on a mossy cliffside in a rainforest, holding a sleek futuristic tablet in both hands. The sky above glows with intense magenta light from a mysterious radiant source hidden beyond the clouds. The (man or woman) studies the interface thoughtfully, then presses a prominent button. Immediately the sky begins to changeâ€”rays of light bend and rotate overhead as the atmosphere transitions smoothly from vivid magenta into surreal hues of deep violet and bioluminescent cyan. As the evolving light source reshapes and shifts color, the (man or woman) responds with visible satisfaction and curiosity. Subtle alien sound cues resonate while the sky's gradient pulses with life. Natural and realistic motion throughout, filmed with a grounded cinematic look as if captured on an iPhone Pro Max 16.
