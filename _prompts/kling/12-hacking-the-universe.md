prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic 9:16 cinematic video of a clean-shaven (man or woman) kneeling on a mossy rainforest log, wearing a plain dark blue T-shirt. A glowing neon-violet keyboard rests on the bark ahead of them, humming with alien circuitry.

  The (man or woman) types rapidly with natural, fluid motion. Each keystroke sends subtle pulses of light across the keys, reacting like sentient technology. In sync with their rhythm, a vertical column of radiant translucent symbols rises from the keyboard, hovering mid-air and orbiting in layered geometries that reorganize into a rotating structure.

  Their expression shifts from concentration to widening curiosity and excitement as eyes track the evolving projection. A final decisive keystroke triggers an elegant expansion: the symbols merge into a sharply detailed holographic map of an alien star system, rotating gently in front of them. The camera pulls back with grounded handheld motion to reveal their amazed reaction and the luminous display suspended in the misty forest.
