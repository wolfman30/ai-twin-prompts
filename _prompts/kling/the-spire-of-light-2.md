prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic vertical video of a (man or woman) standing in awe at the edge of a lush, otherworldly rainforest engineered by a benevolent alien civilization. In front of them, an enormous spiraling column of glowing turquoise light coils skyward around a tall, ancient tree. The luminous spiral pulses rhythmically, each wave sending shimmering ripples through the surrounding air and foliage with natural and realistic motion. Tiny fragments of light drift upward and vanish into the canopy. The (man or woman)'s eyes follow the spiral with a subtle head tilt, their expression bathed in childlike wonder. Gentle air currents tousle their hair and shirt while the structure hums softly. The rainforest reacts as if aliveâ€”leaves gently shifting and bioluminescent plants glowing in sync with the spiraling beacon. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
