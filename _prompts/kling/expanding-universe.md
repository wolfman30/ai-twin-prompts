prompt: |
    In a forest clearing, a (man or woman) crouches over a glowing purple keyboard, typing with focused intensity. As (his or her) fingers hit a final key, the screen flashes, and a massive, translucent alien interface suddenly projects upward in natural and realistic motion. Glowing geometric patterns, star charts, and shifting alien code spiral into the air above the laptop, expanding into a fully immersive 3D holographic display. As the light spreads, the (man or woman) looks up at it directly, (his or her) face lighting up with natural delight and awe. Vivid reflections ripple across (his or her) skin as (he or she) leans back slightly, fully engaged and fascinated by the breathtaking feat of advanced alien technology just unlocked. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
negative_prompt: |
    cartoony motion, slow motion, robotic typing, stiff expression, looking away from the display, glitchy projection, pixelation, flickering light, jerky transitions, blank face, frozen hands
