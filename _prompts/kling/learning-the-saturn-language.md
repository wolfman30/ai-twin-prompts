prompt: |
    A (man or woman) stands in a misty rainforest, wearing a dark blue henley shirt, gazing up in pleasant awe at a floating magenta alien orb just above (his or her) hand. The orb appears solid at first—softly glowing, perfectly spherical, suspended midair. In the first second, it pulses with light and emits a subtle hum, immediately catching attention.

    Suddenly, in a fluid, hyperrealistic transformation, the orb reveals its purpose: translucent alien glyphs begin to unfold downward like data ribbons, rotating slowly in midair between the orb and (his or her) hand. Each symbol glows briefly before fading upward into the sphere. As the glyphs transfer, the orb projects a pulsing ring of light around (his or her) head, as if scanning or unlocking knowledge directly into (his or her) mind. Their brown eyes glow faintly in response, showing subtle fascination and curiosity—not exaggerated, just wide with meaning. Cinematic lighting and fog enhance the moment as the orb begins to rotate slowly, releasing a soft sound like distant singing data. Natural and realistic motion throughout. Shot at 1X playback, high-quality and scroll-stopping.
