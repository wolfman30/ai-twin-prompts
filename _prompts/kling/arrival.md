  The (man or woman) sits calmly beside a small campfire near a misty stream at twilight, magenta and purple light glowing in the sky. In the distance, a glowing alien spacecraft approaches through the mist, descending smoothly with silent precision. The (man or woman) notices the motion and stands up fluidly, turning toward the ship with curious anticipation. The spacecraft slows and gently lands a few feet away, stirring dust and mist in a soft radial ripple. A seamless panel on the ship glows, then silently opens, revealing a subtle interior light. The (man or woman) leans forward slightly, eyes focused with quiet amazement, as if invited. Cinematic camera motion tracks them naturally. Firelight flickers on their side while soft magenta lighting highlights the scene. Natural and realistic motion throughout, like a real moment captured on a high-end phone camera.
