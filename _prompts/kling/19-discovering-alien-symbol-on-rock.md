  Create a 10-second hyperrealistic vertical 4K video (9:16) in a fog-drenched tropical rainforest just before sunrise. Indigo, teal, and magenta set the moody cinematic palette while mist curls around silhouetted jungle trees and palm fronds.

  A clean-shaven (man or woman) crouches barefoot over a mossy stone slab embedded in the earth. An intricate alien glyph carved into the slab glows with pulsing violet-magenta light.

  0–2s — Hook: The glyph emits a sudden pulse synced with a resonant hum, bathing the (man or woman)’s face and hands in light. They instinctively flinch, then lean back in with wide-eyed wonder as the glow rotates subtly, reacting to their presence.

  3–7s — Mid Sequence: The (man or woman) hovers their hand above the glyph, triggering ripple effects across the stone and air. Light pulses intensify and shift hue with each motion. Fog drifts through the frame, catching glints of the glow while nearby puddles shimmer with reflections.

  8–10s — Finale: The glyph sends a slow upward pulse as if uploading information. Expression shifts from curiosity to quiet realization. Just before the cut, a tiny symbol flickers into existence on their forearm (or etched onto the stone), hinting at a larger awakening.
