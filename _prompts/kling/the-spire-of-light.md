prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic vertical video of a (man or woman) standing in awe at the edge of a lush, otherworldly rainforest engineered by a benevolent alien civilization. Before them, an enormous spiraling column of glowing turquoise light coils skyward around a tall, ancient tree. The luminous spiral pulses rhythmically, each wave sending shimmering ripples through the surrounding air and foliage with natural, realistic motion. Tiny fragments of light break off and float upward, vanishing into the canopy. The (man or woman)'s eyes track the spiral with a subtle head tilt, expression lit with childlike wonder. Gentle air currents stir their hair and shirt as the structure hums softly in the background. The rainforest responds as if aliveâ€”leaves shifting and bioluminescent plants glowing faintly in sync with the spiraling beacon. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
