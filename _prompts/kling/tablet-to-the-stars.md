prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic vertical video of a (man or woman) standing in a lush green forest, holding a sleek tablet in both hands. When they tap the screen, a concentrated pulse of light erupts from the center of the tablet, rising vertically with natural, realistic motion. The beam expands smoothly overhead into a massive holographic interface displaying rotating alien structures, star maps, and streaming orbital data. The projection clearly originates from the device, casting luminous reflections across the (man or woman)'s face and upper body while canopy leaves shimmer in response to the signal. They watch with awe and excitement, fully aware that something extraordinary has been activated. Natural and realistic motion throughout.

negative_prompt: |
  cartoony motion, slow motion, flickering beam, robotic tapping, light projecting from hand instead of tablet, stiff reaction, pixelation, glitchy hologram, jitter, floating artifacts, harsh light flashes
