prompt: |

  A hyperrealistic vertical video of a (man or woman) standing confidently in a misty rainforest, wearing a plain dark blue T-shirt with one hand resting on a mossy stone. Nearby, a pulsing magenta hexagon hovers, radiating alien energy. The (man or woman) slowly raises their free hand to lightly touch the center of the hexagon; at once it expands in a stunning kinetic bloom as hexagonal panels unfold in 3D space, forming a transparent high-tech dome humming with subtle motion and faint alien symbols. The structure reacts to their movement, flickering with protective energy and scanning pulses as though recognizing them as a welcome guest. Their expression shifts to impressed amusement, savoring the beauty and function of the alien technology. Natural and realistic motion throughout, visually spectacular and fluid like a real-world scene captured on a cinematic smartphone rig.

  cartoony motion, slow motion, robotic hand gesture, stiff upper body, visual seams in dome, low detail panels, jitter, flat lighting, blank expression, generic expansion effect, synthetic movement
