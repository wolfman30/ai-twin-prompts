    (your-trigger-word:1), a contemplative man in his early 30s wearing a fitted dark blue T-shirt, stands centered in a hyperreal 9:16 vertical frame within a mist-laced tropical rainforest.

    His full face remains visible, eyes glowing subtly with heightened awareness while glowing alien glyphs, fractal symbols, and luminous data rings orbit his head and hands.

    The palette blends deep indigo, violet, and neon teal inspired by Mandy and Blade Runner 2049. Bioluminescent vines coil around nearby trunks, pulsing with organic circuitry as light fog drifts through layered foliage.

    The forest feels ancient yet alive with off-world technology reminiscent of Tron and Dune. Cinematic lighting and shallow depth of field capture an introspective, awe-filled momentâ€”suggesting consciousness expansion, connection, and discovery.
