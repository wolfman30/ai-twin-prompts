    (your-trigger-word:1), rendered hyperrealistically in a vertical 9:16 frame, crouches deep within a mist-laden tropical rainforest awash in cinematic indigo, magenta, and teal tones.

    He leans over a moss-covered stone tablet embedded in the forest floor. Etched alien symbols glow with pulsing violet light, casting reflections across his face and forearms. His hand hovers just above the glyphs—fingers sensing the energy without touching—while his expression stays peaceful, lips closed, eyes gently widened in focused wonder.

    He wears a dark fitted performance shirt and lightweight explorer pants, functional and free of branding. Moisture beads on his skin and cloth, catching soft cinematic highlights that balance stillness with the tension of discovery.

    Surrounding palms, curling ferns, and drifting indigo mist frame the encounter. Subtle breezes disturb nearby leaves, adding depth to the enchanted yet grounded atmosphere. The composition feels scroll-stopping and story-rich—a moment where presence and curiosity unlock an alien mystery.
