    (your-trigger-word:1) walks beneath gigantic alien mushroom-like trees whose undersides glow in magenta and indigo, casting radial light patterns across his fitted dark blue shirt.

    The air hangs thick with violet fog as his arms swing naturally at his sides, hands fading into the mist-laden lower frame while bioluminescent spores drift through the 9:16 scene.

    Cinematic depth captures humid atmosphere, shifting light, and the sense of exploratory wonder within this hyperreal rainforest of luminous fungi.
