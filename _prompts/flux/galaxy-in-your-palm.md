    (your-trigger-word:1) stands in a teal-and-violet rainforest clearing, humidity darkening his plain dark blue T-shirt as mist whorls around towering trunks and bioluminescent vines.

    He carefully connects a glowing teal wire into an alien machineâ€™s socket; magenta data surges out, flowing into his open palm while his face lights with curiosity and delighted focus.

    Atmospheric mist swirls in response to the transmission, catching iridescent highlights in a hyperreal vertical 9:16 frame that captures both expression and intricate alien tech.
