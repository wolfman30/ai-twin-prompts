    (your-trigger-word:1) kneels at the edge of a rainforest stream in a hyperrealistic 9:16 frame, twilight mist hanging in the air.

    A tight dark blue T-shirt clings to his frame as he leans forward slightly, face illuminated by a radiant smile of awe. Magenta and violet shimmer wash across his features while a hovering alien interface casts intricate light patterns on the rippling water.

    The interface appears as a translucent crystalline array hovering just above the stream, emitting concentric waves of magenta glyphs and violet circuitry that dance across the water’s surface. Bioluminescent plants and moss-coated stones frame the scene, their reflections doubling the cascade of alien light.

    Cinematic, photoreal detail captures every droplet and ripple while the rainforest surrounding them glows with subtle alien augmentations—floating nodes, etched runes in bark, and soft teal particles drifting through the mist.
