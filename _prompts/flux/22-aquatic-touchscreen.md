    (your-trigger-word:1), rendered hyperrealistically in a vertical 9:16 frame, stands ankle-deep in the glassy waters of a glowing tidal pool hidden within a tropical volcanic cove.

    Towering cliffs loom overhead, draped in dense foliage and bioluminescent vines. Indigo mist clings to the rock face while storm-kissed twilight paints the sky in electric teal, deep blue, and moody magenta tones.

    Before him floats a half-submerged extraterrestrial device—sleek metal, concentric glyphs humming in cool neon blue and magenta, ancient yet advanced. Translucent holographic interfaces hover just above the surface as if awakening to his presence.

    (your-trigger-word:1) is captured with complete fidelity to his training data: accurate facial structure, hairstyle, jawline, skin tone, and grounded athletic build. He wears a fitted deep navy tech-fabric T-shirt and dark expedition shorts, both damp with mist, devoid of logos or adornments.

    His stance stays open and composed, eyes focused in quiet fascination. The right hand lifts slowly toward the device, catching its glow as reflections ripple across shirt and arm. The scene radiates cinematic stillness—a moment of peaceful contact, decoding alien technology through intuition and calm intelligence.
