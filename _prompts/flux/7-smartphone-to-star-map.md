    In a teal-lit forest glade, (your-trigger-word:1) stands framed by towering bioluminescent trunks, humidity darkening his fitted dark blue T-shirt.

    He taps an alien tablet hovering at chest height, the surface a translucent slab of etched crystal held aloft by humming glyphs. As his fingertips make contact, violet circuitry flares beneath them, casting intricate glow trails across his widened eyes and delighted, parted lips.

    Mist curls around the scene while suspended data motes and hovering root nodes mirror the tablet’s light. Cinematic, hyperreal detail captures the moment the rainforest responds—micro-ripples of magenta energy pulsing through the glade as the alien interface awakens.
