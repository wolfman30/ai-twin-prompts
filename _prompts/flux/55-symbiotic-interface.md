    In a bioluminescent rainforest hollow, (your-trigger-word:1) stands before a sleek alien console fused into the trunk of a towering tree, the device projecting a translucent floating interface at armâ€™s length. A plain dark blue T-shirt hugs his frame while violet-blue light pours from the console, defining every contour with ultra-sharp clarity reminiscent of a 50mm lens capture.

    The interface unfurls layered glyphs and responsive symbols that hover just beyond his fingertips. Soft pulses spill across his face, revealing an expression of joyful curiosity and genuine wonder as he leans in, eyes bright and attentive.

    Rainforest mist swirls around lush teal plants and drifting spores, scattering cool highlights across wet leaves and ambient moisture. Cinematic, hyperreal detail preserves grounded proportions, clean textures, and the calm harmony between human intuition and advanced alien technology.
