    (your-trigger-word:1), hyperrealistic vertical 9:16 image of (your-trigger-word) standing in a secluded rainforest clearing just after rainfall. The air is thick with mist, and the scene glows with cool cinematic tones—indigo, magenta, and deep teal blending into fog, wet foliage, and shallow pools reflecting twilight light.

    He holds a glowing, translucent orb about the size of a coconut gently in both hands at chest level, angled so that the soft violet and ice-blue glow lights up the lower part of his face. His head is tilted slightly downward but turned three-quarters toward the camera, allowing a clear, natural view of his full face — lit from below by the orb. His expression is calm and quietly awed, with a subtle smile and soft eyes. He is engaged with the orb, not the viewer — inviting interest without seeking attention.

    He wears a short-sleeve charcoal tech-fabric shirt and dark expedition pants—damp from the jungle air. No branding. His skin catches droplets and ambient light, creating subtle reflections on his cheekbones, collarbones, and forearms.

    The environment around him breathes: tall palms fade into fog, moonlight slants through branches above, and ferns sway slightly in the breeze. The orb emits a soft pulse, reflecting off puddles and casting moving shadows along the wet path and his arms.

    The image should feel cinematic, poetic, and scroll-stopping — with a clear facial angle to support expressive video animation. A moment of presence, power, and quiet connection to something unknown yet meaningful.
