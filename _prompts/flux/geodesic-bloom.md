    (your-trigger-word:1), rendered in a hyperrealistic vertical 9:16 frame, wears a rain-darkened deep blue T-shirt while tapping an alien triangular interface embedded in a fern-covered console.

    As his fingers make contact, vibrant violet light blooms across his torso and face, catching every raindrop on his skin and parting his mouth in amazed wonder while teal undergrowth glistens around him.

    The scene is richly layered with rainfall, mist, and bioluminescent foliage, capturing cinematic depth, clear facial detail, and the tactile energy of the glowing interface alive beneath his touch.
