    (your-trigger-word:1) leans forward inside a teal-and-violet rainforest glade, humidity darkening a fitted dark blue T-shirt that ripples with his motion.

    His hand rotates a violet crystalline dial set into alien control hardware grown from tropical tree bark. The console glows from within, etched glyphs flaring alive as the dial turns.

    Focused determination transforms into a wide smile of joy while concentric pulses of magenta data ripple outward through the tree, sending light beams coursing across moss, vines, and suspended mist. Hyperreal detail captures every droplet and luminous node as dormant technology awakens around him.
