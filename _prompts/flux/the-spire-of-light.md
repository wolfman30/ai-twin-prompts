    (your-trigger-word:1) approaches a towering alien spire deep within a rainforest, bioluminescent mist curling around colossal trunks and dripping vines.

    Pulses of indigo and teal spiral up the structure, casting shifting light over his plain dark blue T-shirt as he gazes upward in open wonder, his face alive with reverent joy and futuristic curiosity.

    The spire responds to his presence, sending luminous rings through the surrounding fog in a hyperreal vertical 9:16 frame that captures awe, scale, and living alien technology.
