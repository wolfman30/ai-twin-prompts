    (your-trigger-word:1) in a hyperrealistic 9:16 vertical scene, captured from chest-up in sharp cinematic detail, standing in a mist-draped rainforest clearing filled with glowing bioluminescent leaves and violet canopy light. He wears a plain dark blue T-shirt, his face fully visible, eyes wide and jaw slightly parted in a look of genuine awe and quiet curiosity.

    Before him floats a spherical alien construct—like a living orb of plasma and crystal, shifting colors between magenta, indigo, violet, and teal. Suspended midair, it emits beams of light that scan his face and upper torso in slow, deliberate patterns. The orb displays translucent holographic text and unfamiliar 3D glyphs that hover just above his palm as he holds his hand up, interacting.

    The orb speaks to him in pulses of energy. Behind him, subtle ruins are carved into the tree trunks — markings from an advanced civilization. The expression on his face says it all: he understands something profound is beginning.

    The rainforest glows with quiet alien life — pink energy veins pulse under moss, and drones drift through the fog in the background. The scene is a still from an unfolding story: a man learning from beings far more advanced, preparing for something greater.
