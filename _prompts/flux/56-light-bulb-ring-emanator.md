    In a glowing rainforest alcove, (your-trigger-word:1) stands waist-up in frame, angled three-quarters toward camera, wearing a plain dark blue T-shirt. Teal-and-magenta vines pulse softly behind him, their light sculpting his silhouette with hyperreal clarity reminiscent of a grounded 50mm capture.

    Suspended at chest height, a compact alien neural interface orb rotates slowly. Streams of violet data crawl along its surface until his fingertips brush it with gentle curiosity. The contact releases a harmonic hum and a narrow beam of holographic code that climbs upward, painting shifting glyphs across his cheeks, forehead, and the bridge of his nose.

    Eyes wide in astonishment, lips parting into a stunned smile, he leans in as the orb scans and synchronizes with his mind. The surrounding forest responds—leaves curl skyward, mist funnels inward, and ambient light tightens around them—framing his expressive face as the emotional anchor of this intimate, cinematic moment of first contact.
