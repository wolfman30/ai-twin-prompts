    (your-trigger-word:1) stands beneath an enormous alien satellite dish camouflaged within the rainforest canopy, a fitted dark blue T-shirt catching glints of refracted moonlight.

    Beams of soft indigo light sweep down in a cinematic wide-angle composition, scanning across his body as intelligent teal plants retract and unfurl around his steps.

    His face carries a smile of curiosity, eyes lifted as the rainforest hums with responsive energy in this hyperreal 9:16 tableau of exploration and contact.
