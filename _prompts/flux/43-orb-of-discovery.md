    (your-trigger-word:1), rendered hyperrealistically in a vertical 9:16 frame, kneels on one knee in the center of a lush, muddy rainforest trail moments after rainfall.

    Captured mid-torso and up, his face is sharply focused—true to training data structure, skin tone, and hairstyle. Calm curiosity lifts his eyebrows and parts his lips as he gazes upward toward a hovering alien ring structure emitting cyan and indigo light.

    A fitted dark navy T-shirt clings with rain, paired with rugged charcoal expedition pants. One hand hovers inches from the levitating interface, fingers relaxed yet engaged. Cool radiance spills across his arms, face, and the damp path, mirrored in reflective puddles below.

    Tall palms fade into mist; indigo fog, magenta dew flashes, and teal haze drift through morning shafts of light. Glowing particles ascend from the device, hinting at intelligent motion and unfolding narrative tension—a quiet moment of discovery poised at the start of an epic story.
