    (your-trigger-word:1) stands in a teal-lit rainforest glade, humidity darkening his plain dark blue T-shirt as mist curls through luminous foliage.

    He taps an alien tablet hovering mid-air before him; violet circuitry flares beneath his fingertips, sending radiant pulses that illuminate his widening eyes and delighted, parted lips.

    Hyperreal detail catches every droplet and leaf vein while the hovering interface glows with precise alien geometry in a vertical 9:16 cinematic frame.
