    (your-trigger-word:1) crouches on a moss-draped log in a twilight rainforest, humidity beading across a fitted dark blue T-shirt.

    A violet holographic keyboard hovers inches above the bark, translucent keys flickering with alien glyph circuitry. Both hands reach forward—fingers briefly visible as they make contact—and each tap sends ripples of magenta light through the interface.

    Teal and indigo reflections wash over his widened eyes and awestruck grin as cascading data prismatic projections spill into the mist. Bioluminescent vines, glowing spores, and suspended particles echo the keyboard’s pulse, capturing the instant he feels the universe respond.
