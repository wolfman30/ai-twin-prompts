    (your-trigger-word:1), a short-haired athletic man, stands centered in a hyperreal vertical 9:16 frame deep within a dense, misty rainforest bathed in magenta, indigo, and violet light.

    He wears a fitted dark blue T-shirt; his face remains clearly visible, eyes wide with childlike wonder as he interacts with a floating touch-sensitive holographic interface. The projection responds to his gestures with shifting glyphs, pulsating light, and layered data rings.

    Advanced alien technology integrates seamlessly into the surroundings: glowing conduits wrap tree trunks, translucent control panels rise from mossy stones, hovering orbs drift through foliage. The jungle breathes with intelligent light, inspired by Star Trek’s clean tech, Blade Runner’s atmospheric neon, and Mandy’s surreal palette.

    Cinematic lighting, rain-softened edges, and ultra-sharp detail maintain grounded realism—no CGI sheen—capturing a scroll-stopping fusion of nature and future-world discovery.
