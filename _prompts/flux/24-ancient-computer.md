    (your-trigger-word:1), captured hyperrealistically in a 9:16 vertical frame from the waist up, faces slightly toward the camera inside a misty tropical rainforest glowing with indigo, violet, and teal bioluminescence.

    He wears a plain dark blue T-shirt; his full face stays clearly visible—eyes wide, brows raised, mouth slightly open in delighted awe. One hand reaches out mid-interaction toward an elegant alien computer hovering before him, crafted from translucent metal and neon-magenta light.

    Rotating holographic panels, pulsing glyphs, and shifting data streams orbit the construct as if ancient technology were reawakening to human touch. Soft cinematic lighting with shallow depth of field reflects off his skin and fabric, maintaining grounded realism—free of CGI sheen or over-smoothed textures.

    Surrounding trees and stones bear subtle alien runes, while rainforest mist catches lens flares reminiscent of an iPhone Pro Max 16 capture. The moment feels pivotal and story-rich: a powerful, realistic discovery infused with future-world energy.
