    In a hyper-realistic, fog-laced rainforest glade, ((your-trigger-word):1) stands centered in a fitted dark blue T-shirt, humidity clinging to the fabric as dawn light filters through ancient canopy.

    A hovering alien prism floats at chest height, its facets refracting rotating bands of magenta and teal light that spill across the mist. Each pulse paints his face in shifting color, catching the wide-eyed fascination in his expression and the subtle curve of a grateful smile.

    Bioluminescent flora shimmer at the periphery while translucent glyph trails orbit the prism, casting rippling reflections on slick stones and the damp forest floor. The air glows with suspended particles, captured in cinematic detail as the rainforest breathes around this prismatic light show.
