    (your-trigger-word:1), rendered hyperrealistically in a vertical 9:16 frame, stands confidently before a floating translucent screen of alien technology.

    The interface blends advanced AI aesthetics with human UI clarity—layered holograms showcasing digital products, Canva templates, and ChatGPT prompts. He wears a fitted dark blue T-shirt, mid-gesture as if explaining each step.

    His full face remains clearly visible, expression focused yet encouraging—an expert teacher guiding viewers toward new possibilities. Soft cinematic lighting and shallow depth of field capture rainforest mist glowing behind him.

    The environment glows with bioluminescent tones—indigo, teal, violet, magenta—while subtle alien circuitry pulses within foliage and earth, hinting at AI woven into nature.

    Floating text cues orbit the interface: “Step 1: Canva,” “Step 2: ChatGPT,” “Step 3: Launch.” The scene stays grounded and realistic—no CGI sheen, just a scroll-stopping teaching moment in a futuristic rainforest classroom.
