    (your-trigger-word:1) stands in a rainforest grotto shrouded in indigo mist, fitted dark blue T-shirt catching stray droplets as alien bioluminescence glows overhead.

    He reaches forward to push a hovering indigo plate set into an alien podium grown from roots and stone. The moment his palm meets the plate, concentric magenta sequences flare outward, bathing his face in rhythmic light while nearby vines shiver with pulsing energy.

    His expression shifts into enlightened delight—eyes bright, mouth curved in knowing amazement—as data waves ripple through the grotto, echoing across moss, water, and suspended particles in hyperreal cinematic detail.
