    (your-trigger-word:1), image-to-image from the supplied reference, preserved as a hyperrealistic 9:16 vertical composition.

    Keep the framing: the camera floats just outside a luxury-style vehicle window, capturing him waist-up as he leans outward. Translate the car into a silent alien hover craft—obsidian-black with smooth contours and glowing violet inlays—while maintaining his pose, relaxed shoulders, and clearly visible face.

    Wardrobe stays a plain dark blue T-shirt. His expression radiates pure awe, eyes wide and mouth subtly open. Hands rest naturally on the vehicle frame with accurate anatomy and relaxed fingers.

    Replace the background with a tropical rainforest skyline filled with monumental alien ruins. Massively scaled arches, fractured statues, and tiered temples rise from dense greenery, braided with teal bioluminescent moss and humming holographic data streams. Palm trees pierce through gaps in the structures while magenta sunlight filters through indigo mist, casting cinematic reflections across the vehicle and his skin.

    Remove any text or graphic overlays from the reference. Preserve image fidelity, grounded anatomy, and ultra-sharp clarity—as if witnessing a peaceful sci-fi revelation while touring a lost alien civilization.
