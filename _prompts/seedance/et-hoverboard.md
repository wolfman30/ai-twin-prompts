    A (man or woman) stands confidently on a sleek, glowing alien hoverboard as it begins to accelerate smoothly down a misty forest path. The board emits a soft hum and leaves behind faint streaks of violet light as it moves rapidly along the linear perspective of the terrain. The man’s posture is steady and natural, knees slightly bent, with arms subtly adjusting for balance. As he glides forward, the surrounding foliage blurs slightly to emphasize speed. Purple mist swirls dramatically in his wake, illuminated by the hoverboard’s underlight. The man looks ahead with calm focus and anticipation as he’s swiftly transported off screen. Natural and realistic motion throughout.


    NONE OF THE FOLLOWING: cartoony motion, slow motion, stiff legs, awkward posture, robotic gliding, jerky acceleration, glowing errors, pixelation, blank expression, floating glitches, motion blur, unnatural hoverboard movement
