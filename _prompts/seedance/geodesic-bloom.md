prompt: |
    In a lush forest under steady rainfall, a (man or woman) carefully holds a glowing neon magenta holographic triangle just above a mossy surface. With focused intent, they press the shape between their fingers; instantly the triangle pulses with energy and expands outward, unfolding into a complex geodesic dome built from interconnected luminous triangles. The structure assembles rapidly in midair, towering above the forest floor with cascading holographic runes and internal light patterns shifting across its surface while rain streaks sweep around the radiant form. The (man or woman) gazes up in astonishment, visibly awed by the alien architecture they've awakened. Natural and realistic motion throughout.

    NONE OF THE FOLLOWING: cartoony motion, slow motion, stiff triangle movement, blank expression, robotic hand press, flickering glow, glitching dome assembly, pixelation, jitter, unrealistic structure growth, frozen reaction
