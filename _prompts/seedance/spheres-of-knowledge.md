prompt: |
    In a lush, quiet forest, a (man or woman) stands gazing upward with wonder as three glowing violet energy spheres hover above (his or her) open hands. As (he or she) lifts (his or her) arms slightly, the spheres pulse with light and begin to rotate and shift positions in natural and realistic motion, responding to (his or her) gestures. Holographic threads of light connect them briefly, forming alien constellations or data nodes. The (man or woman)â€™s face lights up with amazement, smiling while following the movement with full attention. The particles shimmer and swirl like stardust, creating an advanced alien interface that feels alive and intelligent. Light from the holograms reflects subtly on (his or her) skin. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
