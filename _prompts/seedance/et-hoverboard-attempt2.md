  In a glowing forest clearing, a (man or woman) stands before a large floating neon “200” made of radiant magenta light. As he reaches out and touches the number, it instantly reacts—splitting apart in natural and realistic motion into hundreds of tiny glowing fragments that swirl around him like intelligent fireflies. The fragments form a vibrant holographic celebration: spirals of alien symbols, shimmering data streams, and bursts of luminous fractal geometry all synchronized in joyful motion. The ground briefly lights up with glowing circuits, forming a large alien emblem beneath him. The man’s eyes widen and he laughs with genuine delight, clearly surprised and honored by the display—a congratulatory experience designed by the alien civilization guiding his transformation. Natural and realistic motion throughout.
